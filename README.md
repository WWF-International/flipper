# Card flippy thing

Very much a work in progress. Current code is a proof of concept, rather than anything that can be used yet.

## Aim
To have a gallery of images / grid of content that when clicked, make an image flip and turn around, revealing [something] on the back of it.

## Requirements / dependancies
* jQuery 1.10.2 (as that's the only version this has been tested with)
* modernizr - tests for CSS 3D transforms, CSS transforms, CSS transitions.
* LESS compiler - to turn the LESS into CSS.

## To do
* Make the jQuery cleaner, less hacky [getting there]
* Use CSS 3D transforms, then fall back to CSS transforms, then fall back to fading in. [getting there]
* ???
* Profit.
